# SE7EN                 

#### Some climate scientists say that we only have seven years left to soften our environmental impact.  If we don't?  The end of the world.  

With this in mind, our team decided to create an app called "se7en," an online community for people who want to make the most of their time on Earth. Once a user signs up for their own account, they are given the option to create their own bucket list for the end of the world!  Users can add to their own bucket list, generate random bucket list ideas, search for activities around the world using the google maps API, add other people's ideas to their own bucket list and seek collaborators to help with their goals.  

Of course, the planet is important and we hope that it is around for more than 7 years so we've also given the user an option of coming up with their own environmental action idea which can be added to their bucket list by selecting the "take action" option upon creating a new bucket list item.  This is just the beginning.  More environmental actions to be integrated in future development!
